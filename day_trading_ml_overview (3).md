# Day Trading With Machine Learning â€“ Project Overview

This project explores the design, implementation, and deployment of machine learning strategies for day trading U.S. equities using high-frequency (hourly) data. The focus is on combining supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised methods, with walkforward validation and live paper trading execution through Alpaca.

---

## âœ… Project Goals

- Implement a full end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
- Support both backtesting (QuantConnect) and live trading (Alpaca).
- Apply walkforward validation to simulate real-world trading performance.
- Integrate model comparison, feature selection, risk metrics, and result visualization.

This structure allows storing trained models, scalers, and feature sets per stock ticker for later retrieval during live trading or analysis.

## ðŸ“Š LightGBM Model Performance (Top 5)

These are the top-performing stocks by final portfolio value using the walkforward backtesting pipeline:

| Ticker | Final_Portfolio | Return_% | Sharpe | Accuracy | F1_Score | Drawdown |
|--------|----------------:|---------:|--------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| MSFT   | 113902.79       | 13.90    | 0.2136 | 0.489     | 0.2919    | 20108.83  |
| AAPL   | 106302.43       | 6.30     | 0.1187 | 0.4907    | 0.2495    | 20349.34  |
| NVDA   | 104822.77       | 4.82     | 0.1132 | 0.4813    | 0.2514    | 21230.21  |
| GOOGL  | 103981.14       | 3.98     | 0.1068 | 0.4721    | 0.2432    | 22594.12  |
| AMZN   | 102764.55       | 2.76     | 0.0983 | 0.4682    | 0.2378    | 23985.00  |

Each model was trained using walkforward splits on 720 days of hourly data and tested on out-of-sample segments.

## ðŸ”„ Backtesting Setup (QuantConnect)

LightGBM models were trained directly in QuantConnect using `MinMaxScaler`, 8+ technical indicators, and binary labels for next-hour returns. All models were validated using realistic trading simulations and stored using:

```python
# Save model
model.booster_.save_model("model_AAPL.txt")

# Save scaler
joblib.dump(scaler, "scaler_AAPL.pkl")

# Save features
with open("features_AAPL.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(",".join(features))
```

These files were then downloaded and stored in the `lightgbm/` GitHub directory for reproducibility.

## âš¡ Live Paper Trading (Alpaca)

Alpacaâ€™s API is used to execute the model predictions in a live paper trading environment. The script:

- Loads model + scaler from Google Drive
- Downloads recent 30-day hourly data
- Computes the same technical features
- Submits a market buy order if predicted probability > 0.6 and not already holding the stock
- Skips execution if the market is closed or the signal is weak

```python
# Pseudocode Logic
if market_open:
    if not holding and prob > 0.6:
        buy()
    elif holding and prob <= 0.6:
        sell()
```

## ðŸ”§ Enhancements in Progress

- Execution & Slippage Simulation
- Noise Filtering (e.g., wavelet transforms, denoising autoencoders)
- Market Regime Detection (clustering)
- Latency Simulation & Broker Hooks (Alpaca + Interactive Brokers)
- Online Learning Support
- Modular Risk Management Layer (stop-loss, drawdown controls)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

- Finalize paper trading validation for LightGBM top 5 tickers.
- Extend pipeline to PPO, DQN, SAC, and XGBoost with consistent evaluation.
- Integrate unified model selector and publish full leaderboard.
- Continue preparing public release, documentation, and reproducibility.
